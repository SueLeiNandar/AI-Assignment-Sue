# Lung Disease Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains the full implementation for the Practical Skills Assessment – Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.  
The project applies supervised machine learning techniques to classify multiple lung disease categories using structured clinical data.

The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and explainable AI analysis using SHAP.
